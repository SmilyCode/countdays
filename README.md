# countdays
This Spigot Plugin will count your minecraft days.

## How to work?
You don't need to do anything (except putting plugin to your server of course). The plugin work when a player join a server, then a day is counted.
This way is planned to change tho. because it depend on player rather on world.

This plugin has no command.
